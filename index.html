        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I am a businesswoman and my previous job was a Marketing Manager at Business Partners Firm. I originally went to the University of California, Riverside for a BS in Business Administration and then went on to get my PHD of Marketing Management at USC. Tracing back to my early education, I went to Los Angeles High School and so, I am from Los Angeles, California. I went to school for approximately 12 years and have taken many classes related to business and operations. I am also strong in mathematics, as my classes have mostly covered statistics and business calculus. I was awarded the Math Olympian Award during my undergraduate years as well during an academic competition statewide. As for personal endeavors, I have my own business selling jewelry on the side as a hobby. I mostly sell my items on Instagram or Facebook. I enjoy telemarketing and trying new ways of management, especially of small businesses. I also like to read books relating to marketing methods and how to capture a target audience. Other books I enjoy include real estate books and how to manage financial assets. 
<br><br>

       I am by no means a person who lacks motivation as I have, for many years, developed my own side projects relating to commerce as well. As a kid, I was inspired by my business-working mother, who owns multiple companies across the globe. I wanted to achieve my own success as a businesswoman, and have always had a positive mindset when it comes to striving towards a certain goal. I want to maintain ownership over a successful franchise in the near future. I also have a lot of time on my hands now that I have quit my last job to look for new opportunities around the world. I have traveled to many countries searching for the perfect role to tailor my interests of commercial marketing and real estate management, as well as internal leadership as well. I have previous working experience from numerous locations that I will discuss below. 
<br><br>

       Some examples, however, are that I have been  working as a professional real estate marketing manager for about 5 years and my previous job was a marketing assistant for the global technology company, Sansung. I have worked with many clients and always established professional rapport in order to secure future investments. I have experience marketing products as well, as I was the lead marketing manager at a jewelry and clothing line based in Los Angeles as well- The Reform. I also have experience outsourcing to local businesses and promoting locally. I am well known for being able to handle professional dealings with businesses and I am always willing to try new jobs, new positions, and new places to form professional rigor. I am willing to learn more on the job if needed since I am an active learner and believe in achieving goals as the cornerstone of business productivity. Marketing research is also a skill of mine as I have experience doing SEO work as well, or search engine optimization. I am fluent with current trends and do not hesitate to learn more about different contexts if needed.
